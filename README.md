Project: ShopKart üõí
ShopKart is a basic e-commerce product listing website that allows users to browse products, filter them by category and price, and view product details. This project was built to demonstrate proficiency in creating dynamic web pages, handling data, and building a full-stack application.

Features ‚ú®
Product Categories: A homepage displays different product categories like electronics, clothing, and accessories.

Dynamic Product Listing: Clicking on a category displays a grid of products with thumbnails, names, and prices.

Filtering: Users can filter products by price range or other relevant attributes to refine their search.

Product Details Page: A dedicated page shows detailed information for each product.

Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience across various devices.

User-Friendly Interface: Styled with Tailwind CSS to provide a clean and attractive user interface.

Technology Stack üíª
This project is a full-stack application built with the following technologies:

Frontend:

React.js: A JavaScript library for building the user interface.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.

Backend:

Django: A high-level Python web framework for the backend logic and API.

Django REST Framework (DRF): Used to build the RESTful API endpoints for the frontend to consume.

Database:
